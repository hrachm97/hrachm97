- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Hrach
- ðŸ‘€ After 5 years of experience in the video marketing industry, I discovered that I'm most crafty in the technical processes of animation. The vectors, coordinates, formulas of spatial and temporal interpolations, and other mathematical precise staff attracted me more than the imprecise artistic part of the work. Fortunately, Adobe After Effects provides a command line interface that enables you to dive deeply into the program object model and low-level instructions, pushing the bounds of provided limited tools and inventing your own ones.

- ðŸ›  Now I'm experimenting to create an application that will enable people to easily make standard animations with an easy interface, which will take little time to learn in contrast with the after effects interface, which requires lots of time to learn. That application is actually an interpreter which will translate easy, high-level instructions from the user interface into complicated ones for Adobe After Effects. But for this, the command line interface provided by Adobe After Effects is not sufficient. There must be operations executed outside that program too.

- ðŸŽ“ I attended a software engineering course at Picsart Academy, where I developed skills in the era of computer architecture. Studying from assembly to C programming language, perceiving the levels of computer languages working on physical and virtual machines, and a deep understanding of C++ multiparadigm programming language concentrating on object-oriented paradigm.
