- 👋 Hi, I’m Hrach
- 👀 I’m interested in computer science, mathematics, automation, digital art, motion graphics.
- 🌱 Have deeply studied Object Oriented Programming Paradigm on C++ multiparadigm language.
- 💞️ I automate video creation processes for video animators to waste less time on repetitive and primitive operations and spend more time on creativity and fine art. I handle this applying Adobe developer tools, using scripts and expressions applied in After Effects.
